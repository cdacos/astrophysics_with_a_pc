Sample programs from Astrophysics with a PC
================================

As taken from:
'Astrophysics with a PC' by Paul Hellings, ISBN 943396-43-3
(Copyright (c) 1994 Paul Hellings. All rights reserved.)

The programs in this project are literal translations of the QuickBasic code examples at the end of each chapter. 
They're made available so that the text can be followed using a more common language as of 2014 (python).

The code samples have been tested using python 2.7.5 and compared with the sample data provided.

How to use
---------

To run each program you can call it directly from the command line:

```
$ python ch02_comet_tails.py
```

It will prompt for the initial parameters. (This is how the programs were originally written.) 
For convenience, you can enter the parameters as command arguments. Each file contains an example with parameters defined in the text.
